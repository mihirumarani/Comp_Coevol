### Competition-and-network-evolution

Aim: To analyse how trait-mediated competitive interactions influence the trait evolutionary dynamic of multiple species. 

Simulation approach is taken to study the relative influence of competitive kernels, which describe the context and the functional form of competition between individuals with given traits and trait characteristics (how they vary within species and changes as a result of selection and reproduction). 

The population and trait dynamics is modeled using a simple Lotka-Volterra competitive framework and breeder's equation. The simulation process has two components:

* 1. Selection process: Growth rate and fitness of intra-species phenotypes is affected by trait-dependent competition. Different competitive kernel functional forms represent different contexts of competition. e.g. Gaussian functions with threshold and a triangle function. This selection process alters the abundances and the relative frequencies of phenotypes. 

* 2. Reproduction/inheritance of traits: An explicit quantitative genetic model describes the genetic architechture of the trait and informs how the trait distribution of the population will be altered in the offspring. Two models are employed-
a) Quantitative genetic limit model 
b) Shpak-Kondrashov limited loci model.

Different parameters related to the competitive kernels (threshold and width of competition), Q.Gen. models (no. of loci) and  intraspecific competition (relative weight) are altered to see how they affect the population and the trait dynamic.
